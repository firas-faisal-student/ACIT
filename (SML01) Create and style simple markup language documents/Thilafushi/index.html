        <p style="padding: 10px;"><strong><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi"> Thilafushi</a></i></strong> originally was a lagoon called <i>"Thilafalhu"</i> with a length of 7 km and a width of 200 metres at the shallowest regions. <br />It came into existence following a series of discussions and efforts to resolve Malé's garbage predicament during the early 1990s.<br /> The decision to reclaim Thilafalhu as a landfill was made on 5 December 1991 
            <br />Thilafushi received its first load of garbage from Malé on 7 January 1992. Operations started with just 1 landing craft, 4 heavyload trucks, 2 excavators and a single wheel loader.</p>

            <h4>Waste Management</h4>
            <p style="padding: 10px;">
                Environmentalists say that more than 330 tonnes of rubbish is brought to Thilafushi a day, most of which comes from Malé. <br />In 2005 it was estimated that 31,000 truckloads of garbage are transported to Thilafushi annually, where it is dumped in large piles and eventually used to reclaim land and increase the size of the island. <br />So much is being deposited that the island is growing at a rate of one square metre per day.
                <br />According to official statistics, a single tourist produces 3.5 kg of garbage a day, twice as much as someone from Malé and five times more than anyone from the rest of the Maldives archipelago.<br /> Altogether, that comes to "300 to 400 tons of trash" dumped on the island every day, according to Shina Ahmed, administration manager of the Thilafushi Corporation that runs the island.
    Ali Rilwan, an environmentalist in Malé, said that "used batteries, asbestos, lead and other potentially hazardous waste mixed with the municipal solid wastes being put into the water. <br />Although it is a small fraction of the total, these wastes are a source of toxic heavy metals and it is an increasingly serious ecological and health problem in the Maldives". Bluepeace, the main ecological movement of the Maldives, has described the island as a "toxic bomb".</p>
